## Exampes of Proteomic Analysis

Reproducible data analysis in biological sciences, including when [**"omics"**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omics) technologies are implemented, is fundamental for accepting new knowledge within the scientific community. Some surveys among the scientific community, such as the one found [here](http://www.nature.com/news/1-500-scientists-lift-the-lid-on-reproducibility-1.19970) (published in Nature) address concers with regards to reproducibility in science. Now in the big data era of biological sciences, and non science fields (e.g. economics, business, etc.), providing evidence of reproducibility in data analysis is essential. 

To follow along these lines and contribute approaches to address the reproducbility crisis, this GitHub repository shares big data analysis workflows in [**proteomics**](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/online/course/proteomics-introduction-ebi-resources/what-proteomics). The computer languages implemented in the codes shared in this repo include [R](https://cran.r-project.org/), [**Python**](https://www.python.org/), and [**Matlab**](https://www.mathworks.com/). 

The datasets evaluated with the codes in this repo are publicly available, and have addressed questions in chronic diseases such as [cancer](https://medlineplus.gov/cancer.html), [cardiovascular diseases](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs317/en/), [respiratory diseases](http://www.who.int/respiratory/en/), among others.
